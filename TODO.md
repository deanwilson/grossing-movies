# TODOs

## Select films from more than just 2017

## Ensure none of the random film selections are duplicates

## Keep session state and do a ten question round

## Example of putting this behind nginx

## Handle posters where the film name isn't the same

 * Zhan Lang 2 becomes Wolf Warrior 2 - language
 * X_Men becomes X-Men: Apocalypse - bad `search` parsing

## Build a docker image

 * Allow easier running of the game by bundling it all up
